How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
The way I interpret user needs and use them into the program is to try to have them engaged during the process and prioritize the most important requirements based off these needs. Keep the program available for changes
because the needs might change and we would need to be flexible for these changes. User stories make the process a lot easier because you get more specifics on what they want and can hopefully include it into 
the program we are making.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
The way I approach developing programs is by writing it on paper first to map out what I want to include into it. I take it step by step and code sections at a time to make sure they would run effectively. The Agile 
process I hope to incorporate in the future is Scrum Meetings and Sprint Planning. I think the Scrum Meetings will provide insight and some clarification of the process because one day I might have an issue and another 
day I might not.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
What it means to be a good team member in software development is that you collaborate with the team on your process, share any different point of view that you have and you are reliable with efficient work.
